Bayle the Dread is one of the Elder Dragons created directly by [[Lore/Gods/Primordial Gods/Ymir - God of Creation\|Ymir - God of Creation]]. Arguably the weakest of the three Elder Dragons, Bayle appeared loyal to the [[NPC's Assorted/Dragon Lord, Placidusax\|Dragon Lord, Placidusax]] while he schemed for more power to overthrow his master.
## Description
This huge, 50ft tall dragon, towers over almost all who approach. He has thick, grey-black scales and skin that shimmers blue at the thinnest parts of his wings. He has a massive 100ft wingspan that increases another 20ft when he summons his orange lightning to encompass his wings. He has a large, strong, muscular body, and a large head to fit with 3 curling horns on either side, wrapping around his face. While he isn't the biggest dragon, he is perhaps the most imposing.

## Personality
His primary goal has been to increase his power to rival that of [[NPC's Assorted/Dragon Lord, Placidusax\|Dragon Lord, Placidusax]]. The way he has been doing this is through hoarding magical artefacts and storing them in his pool of pure magic. He often bathes in the pool, growing his strength slowly.

He is quick to anger and viciously violent, often killing for fun and sport. 

## Powers
- Through [[Player Characters/Flike Fyppin - Jake\|Flike Fyppin - Jake]], he has access to [[Lore/Gods/Outer Gods/The Great Wheel\|The Great Wheel]]
- He breaths a mix of fire and lightning
- He can enhance his physical body with orange lightning

## Possessions

## History
### Hidden Ritual
- Bayle made a deal with [[Player Characters/Flike Fyppin - Jake\|Flike Fyppin - Jake]] to join his polycule, and in return, Bayle could channel Flike's powers, giving him access to [[Lore/Gods/Outer Gods/The Great Wheel\|The Great Wheel]].
- He has requested that the party find the [[Lore/Artefacts/Chronos Rune Stones\|Chronos Rune Stones]] and deliver them to him. In return, he will free them from the spell that binds them
