# History
## Founding
- The city was founded 300 years ago (1181) and is part of the [[World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Kingdom of Unurid\|Kingdom of Unurid]]
- The city is an expansion of a human town / village that is now the Old Town District
- Unurid used to be an almost 100% human kingdom, but that has changed in the last 300 years as the kingdom has expanded and absorbed more settlements
- It is built upon the wood elf ruins and the founding is what wiped out the elven settlement
- The city is a bastion for democracy, holding elections for regents as opposed to royal appointments or aristocratic rule
	- In reality, the only rulers are either aristocrats or backed by aristocrats
	- The whole system is corrupt and there is a major inequality problem
	- The city even makes it difficult for people from the poorer areas to travel to the more wealthy areas via checkpoints

## Marpenoth, 1491 (Hidden Ritual Campaign)
- Just after the death of the Regent, Uther.
