The Kingdom of Unurid is a powerful imperial nation originating from the south east of [[World/Material Plane/_Geography/Land/Sonipes Mundi\|Sonipes Mundi]]. It has a long standing royal family and is governed through aristocratic rule with the Monarch at the centre of power. Lord Regents govern cities and are typically awarded that landed title by the monarchy. Unurid finds itself in a constant need to expand its power and wealth, conquering land and taking over key trade routes by utilising its naval supremacy.

## Society
Unurid operates on a strict, feudal hierarchy, placing heavy value on family name. Aristocratic families hold the most power and influence, often holding Lord Regent titles and governing their own cities (with the key exception of [[World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Cities/Gefestmere/Gefestmere\|Gefestmere]]). Blood is more important than wealth in Unurid and is the key factor that dictates your place in society - even if you build up wealth as a commoner, you will always be a commoner until a member of the aristocracy grants you title.

### Hierarchy
1. Royal
2. Lord Regent (Aristocracy)
3. Lord Regent (Voted in [[World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Cities/Gefestmere/Gefestmere\|Gefestmere]])
4. Aristocrat with Landed Title
5. Aristocrat with Title
6. Merchant Class
7. Commoner

### Relations
The Kingdom has had a rocky past with non-humans, expanding into and taking over their territory. One key example is the founding of [[World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Cities/Gefestmere/Gefestmere\|Gefestmere]] in 1181, where the Kingdom of Unurid slaughtered the native Wood-Elves. More recently, however, these other cultures and races have been absorbed into the Kingdom with Elves even taking on high ranking positions such as Lord Regent. Especially among the commoner class, there is much less prejudice due to a sense of class solidarity.

- [[Edrea\|Edrea]] is one of, if not the main rival nation. They are often at war over border disputes and have formed a sort of no-mans-land at the border. 
- [[Kaplin\|Kaplin]] also has an uneasy relationship due to a common goal of colonial expansion into the continent of [[World/Material Plane/_Geography/Land/Tercus\|Tercus]].
- [[Eldertide\|Eldertide]] and [[Ithil'norei\|Ithil'norei]] operate as key trading partners for the Kingdom of Unurid
- [[Sylvaranth\|Sylvaranth]] has an uneasy truce and has begun trading with their new neighbours

## Religion
There is no single core religion in Unurid. The most common religion worships [[Lore/Gods/Planar Gods/Felonia - God of Agriculture and Harvest\|Felonia - God of Agriculture and Harvest]] as many of the commoners work on farms and one of the main products that Unurid produces is food. The military also often works with worshipers of [[Lore/Gods/Planar Gods/Gurzil - God of War and Destruction\|Gurzil - God of War and Destruction]] and employs battle Clerics onto the front lines in their fights with [[Edrea\|Edrea]]

## Government
The Kahler Monarchy founded the Kingdom of Unurid and rules it to this day. From generation to generation, the first born inherits the crown. Currently, Boden Kahler III is the king of Unurid. As the kingdom expanded and absorbed more settlements in [[World/Material Plane/_Geography/Land/Sonipes Mundi\|Sonipes Mundi]], it became clear that the Monarch would need to install Lords to rule sections in their place. Lord Regents have been appointed in major cities to rule over the populace. The title of Lord Regent is granted to the Monarchs most trusted aristocratic advisors with the key exception of [[World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Cities/Gefestmere/Gefestmere\|Gefestmere]], where the Lord Regent is elected.

The outlier of [[World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Cities/Gefestmere/Gefestmere\|Gefestmere]] came to be as it was the first colonial city. The merchant class that facilitated the founding of Gefestmere, helped push for a democratic system that would benefit them as controllers of commerce.

### Prominent Guilds
- The Merchants Guild
- The Church of [[Lore/Gods/Planar Gods/Felonia - God of Agriculture and Harvest\|Felonia - God of Agriculture and Harvest]]
- The Church of [[Lore/Gods/Planar Gods/Gurzil - God of War and Destruction\|Gurzil - God of War and Destruction]]
- The Aristocracy (Faction)
- The Shipwrights Guild
### Laws
The laws in the kingdom generally uphold the strict class structure, allowing for very little mobility. 

## Economy
The kingdom has a strong economy, trading in vast food supplies of meat and wheat. Their conquest has also resulted in them holding the territory that contains Blackrock Forests. The wood from these trees is incredibly strong and can even be sharpened into weapons that rival the best steel. It is far easier to work with than steel, not requiring forging, but does suffer from being a little less durable in the long run. This, and seizing control of the Divine Gate of Enlil, has positioned Unurid as being one of the strongest economies in the world.

The Divine Gate of Enlil, is a key trade route and one of three naval passages that bypasses the dangers of the [[World/Material Plane/_Geography/Water/Eye of Creation\|Eye of Creation]] and [[World/Material Plane/_Geography/Land/The Dragon Isles\|The Dragon Isles]]. It is a key holding for the [[World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Kingdom of Unurid\|Kingdom of Unurid]] and one the Monarchy wants to keep at all costs.

## Military
The main might of Unurid is its navy. It boasts one of the strongest navies, protecting trade routes and shipping lanes with absolute authority. Its infantry is nothing to laugh at either, but Unurid's real military strength comes from its ships, now made with Blackrock Wood.
