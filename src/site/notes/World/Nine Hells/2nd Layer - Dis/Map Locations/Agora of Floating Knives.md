The Agora of Floating Knives is one of the largest trading hubs in the known planes and is welcoming to non-devils.

The Agora of the Floating Knives is an enclave for non-devils made up of floating vessels located on the edge of the great City of Dis. Here mortals can purchase a variety of infernal goods and services.

In the City of Dis you can buy or sell anything, so long as that thing has a chance of harming someone, somewhere. Many of these markets are run by devils for devils, locked away within the cramped streets, behind the high walls. However, Dis is one of the few places in the Nine Hells that can be characterized as even slightly welcoming to outsiders. Travelers visit Dis for many purposes, but a great many come specifically for the Agora of Floating Knives.
