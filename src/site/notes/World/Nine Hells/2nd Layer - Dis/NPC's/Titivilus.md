Titivilus was an archdevil of the Nine Hells who served the Lord of the Second, Dispater. The Nuncio of the Iron Tower was the viceroy and ambassador of his lord, and held increasing power over Dis and its populace as the Iron Duke retreated deeper into his Iron Tower
## Description
Titivilus resembled a 5.5‑foot-tall (1.7‑meter) satyr with pale skin and slightly ruddy cheeks. The fur on his goat legs were black, as were the twin horns protruding from the front of his bald head. He also had small, black, bat-like wings sprouting from his back, and yet despite this was somehow more human-like than a satyr; something was compelling about him, and feelings of kinship were invoked among those who perceived him.

## Personality
Titivilus was not particularly big, strong, or otherwise powerful in the conventional sense, at least by the standards of archdevils, but this physical weakness was more than compensated for by his great cunning and cleverness. He was notorious for his skill in twisting words to confuse his enemies, leaving all those who used them befuddled. Charming and pleasant, Titivilus was an archdevil who had so mastered the art of negotiation that his victims could end up believing him their friend.

Like a contract lawyer, Titivilus always looked for any and all interpretations or loopholes in things said or sworn. And like a politician, he rarely gave definite answers or had a clear stance, yet always appeared to through the tactical use of words and phrases that left ambiguity or deniability. He delighted in puns, cryptic messages, circular arguments, philosophical debates and other methods of verbal bewilderment. He would use jargon and archaic phrases, re-use adages with new meanings, and even invent his own sayings. Furthermore, he might protect his deception under the guise of a polymorph or other misdirection, such as by taking the form of a sage or even impersonating a deity to provide meaningless or outright false prophecies. In any event, what Titivilus said and what his audience thought he meant were typically two different things.

Titivilus's shrewd and calculating ways extended to how he treated combat. He was careful to never engage in confrontations that could not be easily won, and outright avoided the unnecessary ones. Even when facing a weaker opponent he was as cautious as paranoid [[World/Nine Hells/2nd Layer - Dis/NPC's/Dispater - Archduke of Hell\|Dispater - Archduke of Hell]] in battle.

His lack of height and stature have made him quick to anger, overcompensating for these shortcomings.
