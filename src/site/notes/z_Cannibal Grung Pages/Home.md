#### Current Threads
- The list of names - you are yet to find [[World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Cities/Gefestmere/NPC's/Jotaro\|Jotaro]] (who is almost certainly in the prison)
- Who is involved with the ritual?
	- [[World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Cities/Gefestmere/NPC's/l'Gma\|l'Gma]]

	- [[NPCs Assorted/Bayle Fyppin, the Dread\|Bayle Fyppin, the Dread]] wants you to collect the rune stones that bind the ritual
		- If you don't, he says you will all die
- The Duke of Hell
	- [[NPCs Assorted/Titivilus\|Titivilus]] is after the rune stones but you were unable to make a deal
		- He now owns the rights to [[Player Characters/Ale\|Ale]]'s soul
- Information about the ritual:
	- Nature
		- It is a time loop bound by rune stones 
	- [[World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Cities/Gefestmere/NPC's/Martin (DEAD)\|Martin]]'s Info:
		- The ritual will result in the entire city going "poof" (according to [[World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Cities/Gefestmere/NPC's/Pito - Rakshasa\|Pito]])
		- The only way to survive is to buy in. Martin bought in by offering Ale as a sacrifice of sorts
		- The spell that binds you in the time loop will result in your death once enough loops have transpired
		- The spell that binds the conspirators protects them from the effects of the ritual
		- He said he previously lived through what he can assume to be a full loop that lasted around 30 days
		- You are all important parts of the ritual as you make sure each time loop is different. You have great power over the time loop
	- The Cultist beneath the [[World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Cities/Gefestmere/Map Locations/Temple Row/Grand Cathedral\|Grand Cathedral]]:
		- There are 12 total loops
		- You are on the 3rd loop
		- There will be a metamorphosis to transform you into "higher beings" for [[Lore/Gods/Primordial Gods/Chronos\|Chronos]]
			- The cultist calls this a "blessing"
- Deciphering the rune stones:
	- The Stone beneath the Church:
		- The runes marked on this perfectly spherical, smooth stone appear to be the work of both arcane and divine magic. The combination of devout cleric and a powerful wizard. 
		- There is a complex web of runes covering the stone that seem to centre around runes describing the creation of new life, and an exchange of lifetimes to make that possible
		- There is a magical boundary, likely around the parameter of the city, that contains the ritual magic
		- A great divine power is needed to destroy or disable the stone
		- This is one of three Rune Stones
