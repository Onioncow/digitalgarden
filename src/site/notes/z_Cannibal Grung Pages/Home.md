	- [[World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Gefestmere/NPC's/Pito - Rakshasa\|Pito]] and [[World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Gefestmere/NPC's/Celak - Alhoon\|Celak]] know about the ritual. [[World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Gefestmere/NPC's/Pito - Rakshasa\|Pito]] even seems to be aware of, or has ties to The Eternal Night Society

- The Ancient Dragon
	- [[World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Gefestmere/NPC's/Bayle Fyppin, the Dread\|Bayle Fyppin, the Dread]] wants you to collect the rune stones that bind the ritual

- The Duke of Hell
	- [[World/Nine Hells/2nd Layer - Dis/NPC's/Titivilus\|Titivilus]] is after the rune stones but you were unable to make a deal

	- Nature
		- It is a time loop bound by rune stones 
	- [[World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Gefestmere/NPC's/Martin (DEAD)\|Martin]]'s Info:

		- The only way to survive is to buy in. Martin bought in by offering Ale as a sacrifice of sorts
		- The spell that binds you in the time loop will result in your death once enough loops have transpired
		- The spell that binds the conspirators protects them from the effects of the ritual
		- He said he previously lived through what he can assume to be a full loop that lasted around 30 days
		- You are all important parts of the ritual as you make sure each time loop is different. You have great power over the time loop
