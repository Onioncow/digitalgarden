## Description
A 2'6" Red [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Tripkee\|Grung]] that appears quite reserved.

## Personality
After being forcefully turned into a red Grung, l'Gmas' psyche became fragile, unable to cope with the change. Some of the time he is the same mild-mannered Grung from his early days with [[04 Player Characters/w'Ixki\|w'Ixki]] and [[03 NPCs Assorted/t'Qila\|t'Qila]], while other times he is vengeful and vindictive - willing to participate in genocide and put his friends in danger.

>> - [[04 Player Characters/w'Ixki\|w'Ixki]]: they hatched from the same cluster of eggs and has a complicated relationship with him. While they used to be close, their relationship became fraught due to l'Igma's personality shift from being turned into a red [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Tripkee\|Grung]], leading him to ultimately offer up [[04 Player Characters/w'Ixki\|w'Ixki]] as a sacrifice in a ritual that would kill him.

>>[!danger]+ Non Player Characters
>> - [[03 NPCs Assorted/t'Qila\|t'Qila]]: they hatched weeks apart from each other and were initially close with [[03 NPCs Assorted/t'Qila\|t'Qila]] acting as a big brother, but grew apart after their village was sacked. They reunited in the city of [[05 World/Material Plane/03 Cities/Gefestmere/Gefestmere\|Gefestmere]] in the Sewer Grung Village, though their relationship was never repaired.

## History
l'Gma started life as a sickly green [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Tripkee\|Tripkee]], born from the same clutch of eggs as [[04 Player Characters/w'Ixki\|w'Ixki]] and not too long after [[03 NPCs Assorted/t'Qila\|t'Qila]]. [[03 NPCs Assorted/t'Qila\|t'Qila]] looked after him like an older brother, but trio were separated when their village in the [[05 World/Material Plane/01 Geography/Land/Vitria#Leaping Bog\|Leaping Bog]] was sacked and burned to the ground. l'Gma didn't know if the others had survived, but did manage to find other villagers. As they tried to rebuild their village, it became clear they were in need of a new red [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Tripkee\|Tripkee]] to fulfil their tribes Shaman role. l'Gma was chosen to go through the painful alchemical process. Unfortunately, his mind did not fully survive the process, destroying his sense of self.

### Hidden Ritual
- l'Gma tried to restructure world-wide [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Tripkee\|Tripkee]] society, putting Red [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Tripkee\|Tripkee]] (typically the spiritual leaders), at the top of the hierarchy
	- He bought his way into a time altering ritual, with [[04 Player Characters/w'Ixki\|w'Ixki]] as one of the sacrifices
- After the ritual was thwarted, l'Gma fled the city and is now on the run
