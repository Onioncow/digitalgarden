## Description
He appears to be a tall human dressed in fine fabrics and jewellery. His fingernails are long and claw-like but strangely, his hands appear to be on backwards. His face always appears smug, as if gloating while he bears his golden canine. 

He is the head of the Merchants Guild in [[05 World/Material Plane/03 Cities/Gefestmere/Gefestmere\|Gefestmere]] and is considered one of, if not the, richest people in the city.
## Personality
A smug aristocrat. He's not one for choosing direct violence, but he enjoys inflicting it in more underhanded ways. Many would describe him as slimy.
