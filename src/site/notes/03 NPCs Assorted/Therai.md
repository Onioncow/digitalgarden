Therai did always find them a bit irritating, but tolerated them as they seemed to be working towards the same goal. However, once it was clear that they failed to procure the stones for Therai, Therai's view on this group lessened as none of them really seemed that bothered by the impending issue of a more powerful [[03 NPCs Assorted/Bayle Fyppin, the Dread\|Bayle Fyppin, the Dread]]

## History
The moonstone that imbued Therai with magical power compelled them to search out the one who was messing with the natural progression of time. They visited village after village that appeared abandoned, with only strange stones and runes left. This search led them to [[05 World/Material Plane/03 Cities/Gefestmere/Gefestmere\|Gefestmere]].

### [[01 Campaigns/Hidden Ritual/Hidden Ritual\|Hidden Ritual]]
In [[05 World/Material Plane/03 Cities/Gefestmere/Gefestmere\|Gefestmere]], they found the polycule and Amauri, a group of people subjected to a time altering ritual. [[03 NPCs Assorted/Therai\|Therai]] worked with this group to track down the person responsible and put a stop to this magic. They withheld that their plan was to let the ritual effectively kill the group but save the rest of the city. However, the polycule (and Amauri) ended up giving the rune stones to [[03 NPCs Assorted/Bayle Fyppin, the Dread\|Bayle Fyppin, the Dread]] due to [[04 Player Characters/w'Ixki\|w'Ixki]]'s deception. Therai, with the understanding that this would result in a worse calamity, left [[05 World/Material Plane/03 Cities/Gefestmere/Gefestmere\|Gefestmere]] likely in search of a way to stop [[03 NPCs Assorted/Bayle Fyppin, the Dread\|Bayle Fyppin, the Dread]]
