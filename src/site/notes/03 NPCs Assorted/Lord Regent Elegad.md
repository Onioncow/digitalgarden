## Description
A towering 6'9" Half Wood-[[02 Lore/Bestiary/Elf\|Elf]]. He typically appears to be around 50 years old, but is in reality, 309. His age is disguised by a gift from [[02 Lore/Gods/Primordial Gods/Chronos\|Chronos]] that also heavily extended his lifespan. When the disguise is dropped, his decaying form is revealed - he is not undead, but he is close to a living corpse with his artificially extended life.

## Personality
He is spiteful and self-important. He ultimately views himself as the only person willing to carry out the [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Elf\|Elves]] higher purpose of shepherding the "lesser" mortals. 

## Powers

## Possessions
 - He had the [[02 Lore/Artefacts/Chronos Rune Stones\|Chronos Rune Stones]]

## History
He was alive during the growth and expansion of the [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Human\|Human]]s and the decline of Elven rule. Although he was a child of both worlds, he identified more with a radical sect of [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Elf\|Elf]] purists and [[02 Lore/Gods/Primordial Gods/Chronos\|Chronos]] worshippers. Once that sect were killed, he endeavoured to finish what they started with the help of the Primordial God of Time.

### [[01 Campaigns/Hidden Ritual/Hidden Ritual\|Hidden Ritual]]
- He attempted to create a new "pure" race of Elves that would guide "lesser" mortals using the [[02 Lore/Artefacts/Chronos Rune Stones\|Chronos Rune Stones]] 
- In exchange, he would help [[02 Lore/Gods/Primordial Gods/Chronos\|Chronos]] create his own Celestial race to rival [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Dragons\|Dragons]] and [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Elementals\|Elementals]]
- He enlisted the help of some unsavoury figures, including [[03 NPCs Assorted/Donald Trump\|Donald Trump]]
- His plan was ultimately thwarted by the Polycule and Amauri, leading to his gruesome death
