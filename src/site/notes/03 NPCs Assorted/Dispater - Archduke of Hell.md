Dispater was the Lord of Dis and an archdevil whose extreme vigilance almost personified caution. The urbane Iron Duke ruled the Iron City from within his Iron Tower, and was legendary for his impregnable layers of defence.
## Description
Dispater appeared as a 7 ft (2.1 m) tall, dark-haired humanoid with sable skin as cold and hard as iron. His infernal heritage was revealed in several aspects of figure: his glowing, red eyes, small horns, pointed tail, and cloven left hoof. The devilishly handsome archduke dressed in only the finest attire, such as his red robes or velvet gloves, and always wielded his mace-like rod.
## Personality
A master strategist and expert in intrigue, Dispater had a well-earned reputation for being the most carefully calculating of the archdevils. His personal safety was always his top priority, and to catch him off-guard would be to outwit one of the most clever and resourceful beings in reality. During every step of his dominion he acted with patient cunning and unshakable discretion. Although he, like the other archdevils, schemed to take over the [[05 World/Nine Hells/Nine Hells\|Nine Hells]], he avoided taking big risks, not out of cowardice or insecurity but because of his unique view of the system.

More recently however, a flaw had appeared in Dispater's seemingly invincible defense; his never-ending vigilance had been slowly transitioning into anxiety and paranoia. Unless otherwise forced to, he never left his city or even his tower, fearing a fate like Geryon or Moloch before him. No one was trusted, surprises were, at best, unpleasant, and he went out of his way to make clear who was in charge. The gloomy archdevil's paranoia affected his every action[5][6] and the ever-cautious Lord of the Nine had at least nine escape routes and back-up plans at any given time.

## Powers
- Devil's Sight. Magical darkness doesn't impede Dispater's darkvision.
- Fiendish Regeneration.
- Rust Metal. Any nonmagical weapon or ammunition made of metal that hits Dispater corrodes. After its hit, the weapon or ammunition is destroyed.
