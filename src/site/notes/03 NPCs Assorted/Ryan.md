## Description
A proud and gentle beast. He has horns growing from his head that look like a crown. He is uncharacteristically calm and gentle for a [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Manticore\|Manticore]].  His gentle nature though does not change the obvious physical threat that he imposes.

## Personality
He is best described as a "cutie patootie", acting with flamboyance and pomp. This was not his original personality, though powers greater than him altered reality to make it so.

## History
### [[01 Campaigns/Hidden Ritual/Hidden Ritual\|Hidden Ritual]]
- During the events of [[01 Campaigns/Hidden Ritual/Hidden Ritual\|Hidden Ritual]], [[04 Player Characters/Flike Fyppin\|Flike Fyppin]] asked [[02 Lore/Gods/Outer Gods/The Great Wheel\|The Great Wheel]] if Ryan was a cutie patootie in all timelines, and the wheel answered yes, making this once fearsome beast, a cutie patootie. It is now the only version of Ryan that ever existed.
