## History
Many hundreds of years ago, Donald Trump was turned into a vampire spawn by his father. It wasn't long before Donald drank his own fathers blood and killed him so he could ascend to be a full on vampire and take over his fathers businesses and assets. Donald became the richest person in [[05 World/Material Plane/03 Cities/Gefestmere/Gefestmere\|Gefestmere]] with assets all over the city and even outside the city. It was relatively recently that he met the love of his life, [[03 NPCs Assorted/Sleepy Joe\|Sleepy Joe]] Biden, and they adopted a child ([[03 NPCs Assorted/Barron Trump\|Barron Trump]]) together.

### [[01 Campaigns/Hidden Ritual/Hidden Ritual\|Hidden Ritual]]
- He attempted to outsmart the [[03 NPCs Assorted/Lord Regent Elegad\|Lord Regent Elegad]] by altering the [[02 Lore/Artefacts/Chronos Rune Stones\|Chronos Rune Stones]] magic via a blood pool he had amassed
	- He would have forced the world into an eternal night, the perfect world for a vampire
- However, the party managed to steal his [[02 Lore/Artefacts/Chronos Rune Stones\|Chronos Rune Stone]] from under the vampires nose
- He was left alive, but after the failure of the ritual, he left the city and nobody knows where he has gone besides Orlok and Niklaus
