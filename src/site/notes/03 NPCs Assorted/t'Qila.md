>> - [[04 Player Characters/w'Ixki\|w'Ixki]]: Growing up, t'Qila always looked out for [[04 Player Characters/w'Ixki\|w'Ixki]] and was very protective of him. They grew very close before they were split apart by a raid on their home village. When they finally found each other again at brokeback mountain, their relationship rekindled. They met up again in [[05 World/Material Plane/03 Cities/Gefestmere/Gefestmere\|Gefestmere]] during the events of [[01 Campaigns/Hidden Ritual/Hidden Ritual\|Hidden Ritual]] and became even closer. They then decided to move in together in a house on brokeback mountain, where they share a room and are now engaged to be married (in a best friends kinda way).

They found each other again in [[05 World/Material Plane/03 Cities/Gefestmere/Gefestmere\|Gefestmere]] but [[03 NPCs Assorted/l'Gma\|l'Gma]] was already a red [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Tripkee\|Grung]] at this point and his mind and personality had shifted so far away from the person he used to be, that they never quite recovered the bond they once had
