## Description
A 3'3" Grung (tall for a grung) with slimy green skin. His skin oozes a poisonous coating that is slimy and paralyses anyone that touches him. He wears a brown cowboy hat that cannot be removed (its cursed) along with leather boots with no souls so that his feet have better purchase.

## Personal Quests

- [ ] He has a personal vendetta against the Thieves Guild in [[05 World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Cities/Gefestmere/Gefestmere\|Gefestmere]] and is determined to report them to the city guard in every time loop

## History
Born on the 2nd Kythorn 1482 (absolute) of the Second Age, he has a Luna first quarter rising and a Devana waxing crescent rising. 

### Backstory
As a green [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Tripkee\|Tripkee]], w'Ixki is at the bottom of the Grung hierarchy, often tasked with doing menial labour. A red Grung, a healer, shaman, and adviser, has deserted the village and the higher ups want him tracked down and returned. This task has been given to w'Ixki who managed to track his target down to [[05 World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Cities/Gefestmere/Gefestmere\|Gefestmere]].
