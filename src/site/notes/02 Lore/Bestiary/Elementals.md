The Elemental Planes—primordial realms defined by aspects of air, earth, fire, or water—are home to a diverse group of beings known as elementals. Spellcasters on the Material Plane call upon elementals for aid, though these enigmatic creatures can also travel to the world of mortals via interplanar gateways and rifts.

## Sub-races
- Air
- Earth 
- Fire
- Metal
- Water 
- Wood

Each of these sub-races can be found in their respective Elemental Plane or in locations of great power for their element.

## History
As old as [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Dragons\|Dragons]], Elementals used to share the world of Issaeron with Dragons during [[02 Lore/Ages/01 - The Mythic Age\|The Mythic Age]]. They were formed as a by-product of [[02 Lore/Gods/Primordial Gods/Enlil\|Enlil]]'s creation; as the god created the sea, so too did he create water Elementals. They don't typically have such hidden motives like their cousins, the [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Dragons\|Dragons]], and instead adhere to their nature. Fire Elementals, for example, often bring destruction and heedless chaos.

## Religion
These creatures embody their God, [[02 Lore/Gods/Primordial Gods/Enlil\|Enlil]], whole. Their entire existence can be interpreted as a form of worship.

Unlike [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Dragons\|Dragons]], Elementals have not cultivated a cult around their existence. This is likely due to it being far harder to reason with them, but also because they find themselves far less interested in political and social power. 

## Trivia and Useful Info
- Elementals do not age
- Reasoning with an elemental, is like reasoning with nature itself
