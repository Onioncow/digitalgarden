>>1. Humans can be found on all of Issaeron's continents and are quite prevalent 


Humans are diverse and adaptable people with wide potential and deep ambitions.
  
As unpredictable and varied as any of Issaeron's peoples, humans have exceptional drive and the capacity to endure and expand. Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in Issaeron

## History
Humanities rise to prominence in Issaeron is relatively new. Their ever expanding and explorative nature has driven them to all corners of the world. Kingdoms and Nations created and run by Humans started becoming more prominent around the year 800 of [[02 Lore/Ages/02 - The Second Age\|The Second Age]] and they have been expanding since, for better and for worse. 

## Religion
The world of religion to Humans is wide and varied. They typically worship based on need so largely do not worship the Primordial Gods. Gods of war, riches, agriculture, destruction, life, love, death. All are fair game for Human worship.
