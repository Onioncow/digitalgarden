Masters of corruption and architects of conquest, devils seek both to tempt mortal life to join in their pursuit of all things profane and to spread tyranny throughout all worlds. The temptations they offer mortals range from great powers granted by the signing of an infernal contract to twisted favors following a whispered pledge to a diabolic patron, or any number of even subtler exchanges. Those who succumb to these temptations find themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless torment in the pits of [Hell](https://2e.aonprd.com/Planes.aspx?ID=42), wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks.  
Every devil has a specific role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell, from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners. Lowly orts perform subservient labor to more powerful and specialized devils, such as infantry and contract devils, while the greatest nessaris command entire infernal armies.  
  
Asmodeus stands at the apex of the structure he created, but the layers below him are marked by a constant jockeying for position. Most diabolic plans ultimately serve to improve the schemer's place in the hierarchy.

## Sub-races

## History
The Devils are the children of Asmodeus, just like [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Dragons\|Dragons]] are to [[02 Lore/Gods/Primordial Gods/Ymir\|Ymir]]. Created from corrupted souls of mortals raised to the rank of Devil in the tortuous afterlife of hell.

## Religion
Devils aren't strictly religious. They revere their superiors with Archdevils and Asmodeus sitting at the top of that hierarchy.

## Trivia and Useful Info
Devils are principled in their evil. They are tied to contracts and usually manipulate to gain power instead resorting to brute force. It is often in the fine print, that Devils flourish.
