## History
Dragons are the oldest creatures in the [[05 World/Material Plane/Material Plane\|Material Plane]]. They existed during [[02 Lore/Ages/01 - The Mythic Age\|01 - The Mythic Age]] before [[02 Lore/Gods/Primordial Gods/Chronos\|Chronos]] began time. In the [[02 Lore/Ages/01 - The Mythic Age\|01 - The Mythic Age]], the Dragons ruled the world with [[03 NPCs Assorted/Dragon Lord, Placidusax\|Dragon Lord, Placidusax]] as their Monarch sitting on the old draconic throne that existed in what is now [[05 World/Material Plane/02 Nations/Celestria\|Celestria]]. 

During [[02 Lore/Ages/02 - The Second Age\|02 - The Second Age]], the Dragons slowly lost control of the world as mortal creatures began to rise and spread. The stagnant world of dragons slowly transformed into the changing world of mortals with kingdoms rising and falling. Dragons still held power as these deific creatures that were often worshipped and revered. 

## Religion
Dragons have no common relationship to religion. They may have been born directly from [[02 Lore/Gods/Primordial Gods/Ymir\|Ymir]], but they do not worship her as creator. For dragons, [[02 Lore/Gods/Primordial Gods/Ymir\|Ymir]] is simply both mother and father, creating them in her image. Dragons are often worshipped themselves, however. Often to try and appease these most powerful creatures and sometimes in lieu of worshipping [[02 Lore/Gods/Primordial Gods/Ymir\|Ymir]] as the dragons can grant real benefits to their worshippers where [[02 Lore/Gods/Primordial Gods/Ymir\|Ymir]] typically does not. 

## Trivia and Useful Info
