Ymir is responsible for all life in the universe. [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Dragons\|Dragons]] were her first creation and were created in her image. The oldest of which are essentially demi-gods. As with the other Primordial Gods, Ymir holds no core values or tenets, she simply is.

**Primordial God** - As a Primordial God, most people outside the oldest [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Elf\|Elf]] cultures do not worship this God directly. Primordial Gods tend to not grant gifts to their worshippers the same way Planar Gods do.
