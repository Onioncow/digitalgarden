# Description
These rune stones can control time. The most advanced of which can be combined to create a time loop that devours timelines, erasing the affected creatures from existence

Notably, these were used during the Hidden Ritual campaign in [[05 World/Material Plane/Kingdom of Unurid/Cities/Gefestmere/Gefestmere\|Gefestmere]]. [[03 NPCs Assorted/Lord Regent Elegad\|Lord Regent Elegad]] used them to trap the entire city in a time loop.

They are small stones, polished perfectly smooth with small, intricate Elvish runes engraved on all sides. The dialect is an ancient Elvish and is incredibly difficult to translate due to the complexity.

## Stone 1 - The Rune of Creation
This stone is the primary stone used for the creation of new life and governs everything new created by this power and controls the exchange necessary to achieve it. The intended purpose was for this stone to create a new species, one to rival the [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Elementals\|Elementals]] and [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Dragons\|Dragons]].

## Stone 2 - The Rune of the Celestial
This stone is the primary stone used to control the celestial bodies bound to time. This stone is used to stabilise the ritual, maintaining the timeline and protecting the new timeline that is created. It is believed to be the least powerful of the stones and was given to [[03 NPCs Assorted/Donald Trump\|Donald Trump]] to safeguard due to this. However, [[03 NPCs Assorted/Donald Trump\|Donald Trump]] found a way to manipulate this stone with ancient moon ritual magic, allowing him to halt the day / night cycle.

## Stone 3 - The Rune of Rebirth
This is the most fundamental part of the ritual, allowing for the rebirth of dead creatures. It is responsible for keeping the subjects of the ritual alive through the timelines and then leaching the time energy created by those subjects. Those subjected to this stone are often transformed into Woe Striders upon death, with their purpose incomplete.

[[03 NPCs Assorted/Lord Regent Elegad\|Lord Regent Elegad]] planned to use this stone to create a new "pure" race of [[02 Lore/Bestiary/Elf\|Elves]] based on a past long gone.
