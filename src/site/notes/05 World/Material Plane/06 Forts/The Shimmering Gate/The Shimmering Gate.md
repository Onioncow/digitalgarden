The Shimmering Gate stands on the border of [[05 World/Material Plane/02 Nations/Dracaryn\|Dracaryn]] and [[05 World/Material Plane/02 Nations/Celestria\|Celestria]]. A giant structure that straddles the large valley, protecting [[05 World/Material Plane/02 Nations/Celestria\|Celestria]] from invaders. It is one of two ways into Celestria but is the preferred route to take. The alternative path from [[Underkeld\|Underkeld]] is a long road with no water, and monsters roaming free.

# History
## Founding
This great fort was one of the first structures ever built by mortals. It was built by [[03 NPCs Assorted/Lady Maria, The Living God\|Lady Maria, The Living God]] and her loyal followers. It has always kept the waring of other nations out and her Order of Light in.
