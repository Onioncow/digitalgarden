## History
### One Shot Fellas - 7th Alturiak 1491
- The village was surrounded by a mist caused by the devil worshipping mayor, Varamin.
- The mayor had made a deal with a devil, using one of the devils servants (a Vermalek) to harvest souls for the devil, and in return he'd be given riches
- A band of adventurers arrived at the village and managed to thwart this plan, killing the Vermalek and the mayor was pulled into hell to spend eternity as a formless slug-like creature
