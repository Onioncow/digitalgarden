Tripkees resemble humanoid tree frogs, with oversized eyes, wide mouths, and gangly physiques. Their slight frames and large toes can afford excellent grip while climbing, while their colorful skin provides reliable camouflage that varies by their home environmentâ€”green and brown for jungle-dwelling groups, blue and orange for riparian communities, and many other colors between. A tripkee grows quickly, reaching their adult size of approximately 2 feet in height about 3 years after hatching, though they're only considered adults around age 12. Tripkees rarely live beyond 60 years, though exceptional individuals occasionally live as long as a century

## Sub-races
The skin colours of Tripkee often denote their role.
- **Blue** are workers and artisans
- **Green** are warriors, hunters, and labourers
- **Red** are healers and shamans, spiritual leaders
- **Gold** are elite warriors and tribe leaders

## History
Taught to wait, observe, and respect natural processes of life and death, many tripkees adopt patient attitudes.

Tripkees lead a sophisticated hunter-gatherer lifestyle within which they reshape the landscape to suit their needs: building spillways to trap fish, seeding fruit-bearing trees, sowing cover-granting foliage for future hunts, and more techniques that often escape an agriculturist's eye. These strategies rely on community cooperation as well as dispersed populations, so tripkees commonly live in small villages, each part of a complex web of alliances and relationships. Reclusiveness has preserved tripkee lives and lifestyles for millennia, yet they increasingly find themselves threatened by ancient evils and new explorers alike.

## Religion
Tripkees usually worship lesser known Gods and spirits of nature.
