As an ancient people, elves have seen great change and have the perspective that can come only from watching the arc of history. Elves value kindness, intellect, and beauty, with many elves striving to improve their manners, appearance, and culture. Their studies delve into a level of detail that most shorter-lived peoples find excessive or inefficient.

While generally taller than humans, elves possess a fragile grace, accentuated by long features and sharply pointed ears. Their eyes are wide and rounded, featuring large and often vibrantly colored pupils that make up the entire visible portion of the eye. These pupils give them an alien look and allow them to see sharply even in very little light.  
  
Elves gradually adapt to their environment and their companions, and they often take on physical traits reflecting their surroundings. An elf who has dwelled in primeval forests for centuries, for example, might exhibit verdant hair and gnarled fingers, while one who's lived in a desert might have golden pupils and skin. Elves reach physical adulthood around the age of 20, though they aren't considered to be fully emotionally mature by other elves until closer to the passing of their first century. A typical elf can live to around 600 years old.

## History
Elves are the oldest mortals and great observers of [[Lore/Ages/02 - The Second Age\|The Second Age]]. They have watched Issaeron transform as more and more civilisations grow and mature. [[Lore/Bestiary/Dragons\|Dragons]] used to be a very important part of their culture as they appeared Divine in nature. This focus on Dragons lessened as mortals became more and more prevalent, creating and maintaining Gods with their worship. The oldest of the Planar Gods owe their gratitude to the Elves for bringing them into existence.  

## Religion
Elves are one of the few people that still worship Primordial Gods ([[Lore/Gods/Primordial Gods/Ymir\|Ymir]], [[Lore/Gods/Primordial Gods/Chronos\|Chronos]], [[Lore/Gods/Primordial Gods/Enlil\|Enlil]]). Elves are often emotional and capricious, yet they hold high ideals close to their hearts. Outside of the Primordial Gods, they prefer deities who share their love of all things mystic and artistic..

## Trivia and Useful Info
The inborn patience and intellectual curiosity of elves make them excellent sages, philosophers, and wizards, and their societies are built upon their inherent sense of wonder and knowledge.

Elven names consist of multiple syllables and are meant to flow lyricallyâ€”at least in the Elven tongue.
