Tanuki delight in pranks and practical jokes, especially those that allow them to take the high and mighty down a notch and show them what life is like for everyone else. Where other peoples take pride in their storied histories, noble traditions, or intricate ceremonies, tanuki take pride in their simplicity and disregard for the world's many rules. Though some might claim this outlook reduces tanuki to uncouth rubes, tanuki feel it makes them more cultured; after all, one must know a rule to bend it, and one must understand a norm to break it.

Tanuki are short humanoids who resemble bipedal raccoon dogs, usually growing between 3 and 4 feet tall. They tend to have rotund bodies, with large bellies that appear even wider due to their thick fur. A tanuki's face is likewise round, with wide-set, alert eyes outlined within a dark mask of fur. Tanuki have a single bushy tail that they take great pride in and to which they ascribe their powers. These qualities together give tanuki a strong cultural appreciation for rounded shapes over sharp angles, such as daruma dolls, circular doors, and the moon.

## Religion
Tanuki do not have a particular preference of Gods, preferring to lead a simple life that does not adhere to any specific deity.
