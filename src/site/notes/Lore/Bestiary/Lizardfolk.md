_Lizardfolk are scaled humanoids with a history that stretches into the distant past._  
  
Lizardfolk are consummate survivors, heirs to empires considered ancient even by the elves.

Lizardfolk vary depending on their environment, but share toothy snouts and long, powerful tails. Many sport dorsal spikes or flashy neck frills that hint at their clan lineage. Lizardfolk reach physical adulthood at age 15 and live up to 120 years. The average lizardfolk stands 6 to 7 feet tall, but grows throughout their lifetime, gaining strength and size with age.

Known among themselves as iruxis, lizardfolk are raised communally from the moment they break from their shells. They have an oral tradition stretching back to the [[Lore/Ages/01 - The Mythic Age\|Mythic Age]], brought to life through epic poems, evocative carvings, and ancestral rites performed among fields of fossilized bone. Lizardfolk are passionate astrologers with one eye on the future. If they seem slow to act, it's because their long history has taught them the value of patience.

## History
Lizardfolk, while mortal, are not considered mortals, like [[Lore/Bestiary/Elf\|Elves]] and [[Lore/Bestiary/Human\|Human]]s. They served the [[Lore/Bestiary/Dragons\|Dragons]] during the [[Lore/Ages/01 - The Mythic Age\|The Mythic Age]], with many revering them as messengers of the Dragons. Lizardfolk have a deep history lost as time began, forcing them to age and forget. Still, they follow the Dragons, congregating where Dragons are active. 

## Religion
While they serve Dragons, they do not treat them as Gods like Mortals did/do. The Lizardfolk find themselves following Gods of nature, or participating in spiritual practises such as druidic rites.
