# Outer Gods
The Outer Gods are eldritch horror like beings with absolute power. They exist outside the planes of existence and are completely inconceivable to the minds of mortals; even their true names are beyond understanding.

# Primordial Gods
These are the first Gods and govern core concepts of the multiverse such as creation and time. Unlike Planar Gods, the Primordial Gods don't grow or lose power based on who is worshipping them or how prevalent their core concept is right now.

# Planar Gods
These Gods gain and lose power based on their worshippers and how prevalent their core concept is in the world. For example, the God of War gains power during times of great conflict. Because of this, these Gods are often scheming to grow in power over their siblings. These Gods were all created by Ymir, the Primordial God of Creation.
